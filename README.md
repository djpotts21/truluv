# TruLuv Dating
## Purpose:
At TruLove, we're all about bringing people together, no matter who they are or who they love. Our goal is simple: to create a dating app where everyone feels welcome and accepted. We want to give you a place to explore connections without worrying about being judged for who you are. TruLove is here to help you find your perfect match, whatever that looks like for you. So whether you're straight, gay, bi, trans, or anywhere in between, we've got your back. Let's make finding love easy and fun for everyone.

## Overview:
TruLove, our cutting-edge dating application, is built upon a sophisticated technical stack to provide users with a seamless and inclusive experience. TruLove utilises Heroku as its hosting platform, ensuring scalability, reliability, and effortless deployment. We rely on PostgreSQL (Postgres SQL) for its robust data storage, retrieval, and management features, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance.

Powering the backend infrastructure is Python Django, a high-level web framework renowned for its rapid development capabilities and security features. With Django, we effortlessly handle user authentication, data modelling through ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), routing, and templating, enabling us to focus on delivering a consistent and responsive user experience.

TruLove uses Bootstrap as its core on the front end, a leading front-end framework known for its mobile-first approach and extensive set of UI components and styles. We craft a visually appealing and intuitive user interface that seamlessly adapts to different devices and screen sizes by leveraging Bootstrap's grid system, typography, and CSS utilities.
